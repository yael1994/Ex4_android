# FlightGear-Simulator-Android-App
An Android application designed to fly a FlightGear aircraft using a custom joystick.

In this app, I need to create two activity:
  1. Login Activity - connect to server (in this project we get the server, But you can connect to a flight simulator).
  2. Joystick Activity - a jostic that every move of him change the movement of the plan.
  
## Login Activity
A login window will appear where you start the program

``` 
Once you are connected, the joystick screen will appear.
